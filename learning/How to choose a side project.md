### Questions

- Does the problem you're solving have strict limits and boundaries?
- Are you valuing the problems that your code solves or the code itself?

### Content

If you are building a side project choose one that solves a specific, limited problem. For example, let’s say you feel you’re wasting time playing on Facebook when you should be doing homework.

“Build the best time tracking app ever” is neither limited nor specific, nor is it really a problem you’re solving.
“I want to keep track of how much time I spend actually working on homework vs. procrastinating” is better, but still not quite problem-driven.
A good problem statement is “I want to prevent myself from visiting Facebook and other specific websites while I’m working on homework.” At this point you have a clear sense of what software you’re building.
Why a specific and limited problem?

The problem statement will tell you whether you’re making progress: are you any closer to solving the problem? Is the work you’re doing actually related to the problem at all?
By limiting the problem you increase your chances of successfully building something usable. If you finish it and want to keep going, great, add another problem to expand its scope. But start with something small.

### Software has no value

Software is just a tool, there is no inherent value in producing more; value is produced by solving problems or the entertainment value of a game. A half-solved problem or a half-finished game are valueless, so you want your initial goal to be small and constrained.

I’ve learned this the hard way, focusing on the value of my code instead of on the problems it solved.  Focus on the product ability to solve problems.
