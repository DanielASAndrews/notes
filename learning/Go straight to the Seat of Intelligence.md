### Questions

- Are you as close as possible to the source for what you want to learn?

“Every person has two educations,” Edward Gibbon, once said, “one which he receives from others and one, more important, which he gives himself.”

So instead of ‘find yourself a mentor,’ I think there is a far better dictum to follow. It comes from a relatively unknown line from Marcus Aurelius. But it’s simple and clear:

“Go straight to the seat of intelligence–your own, the world’s, your neighbors.”

That is, generally, when you’re looking to learn about something get as close the source as humanly possible. Sometimes that will be reading the primary texts. Sometimes that will be connecting with smart people. Sometimes that will be looking inward or immediately around you.

When I think about my own education and any success I might have, it’s because I followed that line of thinking, knowingly and unknowingly.

But that’s the problem: people think they’re learning but they are so far away from the epicenter. They’re stuck in some school. They in some backwards job where people do things ‘the way they’ve always been done.’
