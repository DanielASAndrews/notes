For many, it’s because they love being a victim. They love how it arouses sympathy, lowers expectations, excuses negativity, and relieves the burden of personal responsibility, and how putting their difficulties on display convinces people to judge them more leniently for their shortcomings and failures and praise them more enthusiastically for their successes.

“Everything that happens is either endurable or not,” wrote the legendary Roman emperor and stoic philosopher Marcus Aurelius. “If it’s endurable, then endure it. Stop complaining. If it’s unendurable, then stop complaining. Your destruction will mean its end as well. 

Just remember: you can endure anything your mind can make endurable, by treating it as in your interest to do so. In your interest, or in your nature.”So don’t go looking for sympathy. Most people don’t care about your problems and many are secretly glad that you have them.

Don’t compromise your standards. No matter what you want to do, moderation won't get you very far. Nothing succeeds like excess.Don’t shirk your duties. Remember that the more you suffer voluntarily, the less you’ll suffer involuntarily.

If you don’t like something, do something to change it. Don’t complain, just work harder. And if you ultimately can’t change it--no matter how undeserved or unreasonable it is--then change your mind about it.To quote Aurelius again, “Choose not to be harmed, and you won’t feel harmed. Don’t feel harmed, and you haven’t been.”

So remember:When someone deals mostly in complaints, all they’re really saying is they lack the gumption to act, to have the courage of their convictions. Instead, they sit on the sidelines and do the only thing they’re capable of: carping and criticizing those that are in the arena, struggling and striving. Pay these people no mind.
