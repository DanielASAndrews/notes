### Questions

- Are you feeling comfortable at work? You aren't learning
- Am I looking for opportunities to teach someone so that I can learn the topic better?
- Am I learning skills (testing, refactoring, API design, debugging, devops) instead of technologies?

### Content

There’s an easy way to tell whether you’re learning or not: learning is uncomfortable. If you’re in your comfort zone, if you’re thinking to yourself “this isn’t so hard, I can just do this” you’re not learning. You’re just going over things you already know; that’s why it feels comfortable.

If you’re irritated and a little confused, if you feel clumsy and everything seems harder than it should be: now you’re learning. That feeling of clumsiness is your brain engaging with new material it doesn’t quite understand. You’re irritated because you can’t rely on existing knowledge. It’s hard because it’s new. If you feel this way don’t stop: push through until you’re feeling comfortable again.

### Teaching

If you have colleagues you work with you will occasionally see them do something you think is obviously wrong, or miss something you think is the obviously right thing to do. For example, “obviously you should never do file I/O in a class constructor.”

When this happens the tempting thing to do, especially if you’re in charge, is to just tell them to change to the obviously better solution and move on. But it’s worth resisting that urge, and instead taking the opportunity to turn this into a learning experience, for them and for you.

The interesting thing here is the obviousness: why is something obvious to you, and not to them? When you learn a subject you go through multiple phases:

Conscious ignorance: you don’t know anything.
Conscious knowledge: you know how to do the task, but you have to think it through.
Unconscious knowledge: you just know what to do.
When you have unconscious knowledge you are an expert: you’ve internalized a model so well you apply it automatically. There’s are two problems with being an expert, however:

It’s hard for you to explain why you’re making particular decisions. Since your internal model is unconscious you can’t clearly articulate why or how you made the decision.
Your model is rarely going to be the best possible model, and since you’re applying it unconsciously you may have stopped improving it.
Teaching means taking your unconscious model and turning it into an explicit conscious model someone else can understand. And because teaching makes your mental model conscious you also get the opportunity to examine your own assumptions and improve your own understanding, ending up with a better model.

You don’t have to teach only colleagues, of course: you can also write a blog post, or give a talk at a meetup or at a conference. The important thing is to notice the places you have unconscious knowledge and try to make it conscious by explaining it to others.

Another way to learn is to learn from experts that don’t work with you. It’s tempting to try to find experts who will teach you new technologies and tools, but skills are actually far more valuable.

### Skills over Technologies

Programming languages and libraries are tools. Once you’re an experienced enough programmer you should be able to just pick them up as needed if they become relevant to your job.

Skills are trickier: testing, refactoring, API design, debugging… skills will help you wherever you work, regardless of technology. But they’re also easier to ignore or miss. There are skills we’d all benefit from that we don’t even know exist.

Try to find the results of experts breaking down their unconscious models into explicit models, for example:

Sandi Metz’s talk “Nothing is Something”, about API design, branching and nulls.
My attempt, probably not in the same league as the previous two talks, to explain how you should choose to test your software.
