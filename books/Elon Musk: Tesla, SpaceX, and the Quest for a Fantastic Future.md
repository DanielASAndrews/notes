### Content

Engineers work failed after 2 years , 4 years with falcon rocket launches

Elon almost died from malaria , by luck a malaria specialist doctor saw his blood and saved his life

Elon got beaten up as a kid (it actually broke his nose) , betrayed by one of his close friends and so he was closer with his family as his friends , especially his brother Kimbal

Take things apart and put them back together just to understand how they work, we’re built , and the inner workings - inquisitive spirit

Elon went to Queens because he thought the women there looked better than Waterloo 

Elon got kicked out of PayPal with a vicious coupe (he was on a flight for his vacation honeymoon trip , plus he hadn’t taken a vacation in forever) that put Thiel back as the ceo 

Elon got the help of extremely talented people to work with him on his goals (Holeman, Strabel, etc.)

He lost Holeman for blaming him and his team for rocket failure , this was a mistake of losing talent 

Elon switched from ultra capacitors to lithium ion for the emergence of Tesla 

Founders of Tesla (Tarpening, Ebberhard) underestimated the current state of supply chain of large car manufacturers. Car manufacturers only do combustion research and the final assembly of cars .. all the parts they get from other companies- they don’t do it themselves 

Silicon Valley mindset is to hire a bunch of hungry young engineers and figure things out as you go along 

Tesla found it cheaper to do complicated work in house , rather than offshoring. Offshoring idea in Thailand made things take longer and more to expensive

Elon was respected for his drive and execution of goals, and disliked for his personality. This is similar to the experiences working with Steve Jobs

Designed the office so engineers walk past texhinicisns working on the rockets and always had a view of this 

Perform metrics on Space x in house electronics vs commercial ones , and then replace them when theirs is better

Space x talent recruitment looks for people with a mechanical background and mechanical projects 

Space x final interview with Elon usually has him paying you no attention but don’t mind it, and then he asks you a riddle

Elon would ask engineers questions about rocketry to fill in his knowledge gaps , plus textbooks . He initially had no knowledge in this area and made mistakes refusing to buy parts the engineers asked for 

Don’t use acronyms that are not used widely in the industry (e.g GUI is okay , but VCS is not) they create barriers in communication, especially for new hires. And people who don’t know them in meanings tend to accept ignorance than ask what they mean as risk looking embarrassed 

If people don’t get rewarded for changing rules for the better , then they feel afraid of changing rules for fear of punishment which is more typical when the rule changes don’t work out . This is a hamper to progress. Rules should not block progress 

Tesla start with luxury market and then make it cheaper over time, and marketing matches this

Each of Elon’s products (solar city , Tesla, space x) feed into each other and provides mutual success

Your intuition about the things you don’t know about isn’t very good. You always need to start at first principles of a problem - what are the physics of it , how much time will it take, what’s the cost , how can I make it cheaper ?
