CIA couldn’t tell their agents were double agents in Cuba and east Germany, what hope do we have in knowing when people are lying ?

None of key English figures got the correct read off of Hitler after meeting with him for hours

Judges who meet a defendant were far worse than a computer making a decision based on limited data. How is that can we be worse off after meeting a stranger than not meeting them ?

People struggle with assessing a strangers honesty , intent , and character

The illusion of asymmetric insight: There’s is a very strong bias we have that we know others better than they know us. This leads us to talk when we should very much listen , and to be less patient than we ought to when other express that they are being judged unfairly or treated unfairly - leading to the conclusion that judging others is easy

The one thing you should take from this book : Strangers are NOT easy 

We default to truth, we believe people are honest until we receive enough contrary evidence 

And we often explain away doubts, until we can’t anymore. The power to default to truth is so strong that it takes a series of doubts over time before we realize

The holy fool aka the whistleblower 

Why haven’t we evolved to be good lie detectors ? Because detecting lies is a lot of effort and is detrimental to one of humans greatest abilities : to be able to cooperated with strangers

New theory on alcohol is that it’s not a disinhibitor, but myopic (tunnel vision). It gives you short term vision and enhances what’s in your environment. You don’t consider the long term 
How can you negotiation consent when alcohol brings us so far away from our true selves ?

In blackout mode you are able to function normally and perform complex tasks but without memory. Memory is selective as well, not based on emotion or importance

Sleep deprivation vastly ruins memory and when used in torture purposes, it creates compliance rather than truth (e.g KSM claiming so many terrorist acts)

There is high coupling is suicide, meaning that the method used and it’s ease of access affects how many suicides actually occur (e.g reduction in suicide rates after the English switched off town gas). Imagine how many suicides could be prevented in the U.S. if they didn’t have access to handguns? It’s also affected by emotions and decisions in the moment

Crime is coupled to place 

Cops are trained to interrogate to avoid defaulting to truth
