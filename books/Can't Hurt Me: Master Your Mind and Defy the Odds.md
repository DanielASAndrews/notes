Don’t stop when you’re tired, stop when you’re done

Find out who you really are by reaching for your full potential 
Motivation is crap , you have tons of it when everything is perfect and going well... but it’s gone as soon as it isn’t 

Challenge 1: what’s the worst things that happened to you , give your pain shape , your bad hand, what are the current factors that are limiting your growth ? Are you too comfortable ? Always remember opportunity cost 

You have to find power in the negative things in your life - own it, it’s a part of your life whether you like it or not. You better start liking it and not letting it hurt you . Other people might have a head start , but that’s not what’s gonna affect the change for you 

It’s about thriving when been given a fucked up hand - and to still succeed/win that’s powerful. Being amazing in a situation when people expect you to lose 

There’s so much power from all the crap we live in, it’s about looking at it the right way.  You’ll use these to fuel your ambition for success 

Questions to own your story:
How can you become you’re own hero ?

Do you think you’re gaming the system ? You’re probably gaming yourself 

If you stand in the mirror, remembering your 18 year old self, would you be proud of what you see?

Always be real with yourself looking in the dirty mirror , stop lying to yourself for a couple mins just to feel better - call yourself out 

Use your negatively as fuel to better yourself - get thick skin 
Personal accountability will give you self respect, and that always lights a way forward 

You accomplish nothing by putting off work to put up a front 

Try post it notes by a mirror , put your goals where you’ll constantly see them , aka use Trello board plus physical one

Only listen to the voice in your head that sucks , the other one is a voice of comfort

Your mind always wants the path of least resistance 

Challenge 2 

Accountability mirror - put up all your insecurities, dreams, and goals - the mirror doesn’t lie 

Abolish the ego with this challenge 
Then put up a way to improve it or finish it if it’s a goal , in small steps / scope to solve the ultimate goal
When the world tries to convince you that everyone’s a winner , and you believe that , you’re just losing - be able to criticize yourself, everyone fucks up 

People hate to admit that they’re
wrong , it’s so much easier to blame somebody 

Bullies may be harsh, what they say hurts your feelings , and yeah no one wants to hear it. They might be telling you the truth. Growth that thick skin, come back and say hey look at me now 

Friends might be hurting your growth , telling you what you want to hear . Pick friends that hold you to a higher standard

Challenge 3 - do things that make you uncomfortable to make you strong, triple down on weaknesses 

Taking souls - when you do what other people think is too hard / impossible , you break them . Don’t believe how other people tell to expect to feel. In reality you’re just playing against your own mind - program it what you want to do at that specific time 
People will try to break your spirit because you just broke their spirit. Keep treading

When you as a leader are concerned for others wellbeing’s, you forget about your own problems .. which can be a good thing cause it gets you out of your head and your bad thoughts

Manage your relationships by being great, but becareful - do it with humility.

See your life as a training ground , hardships are calluses for the mind. Otherwise the calluses will be resentment if you see yourself as a victim of circumstances 

Tap into the sympathetic nervous system by remembering what you’ve been through before (e.g climbing machu piccu) to help you choose fight over flight 

This will help you manage doubt and make it the backstreet driver for the task at hand 

You want to get to the point in your life where all these things you’re supposed to do or should of done bothers you, it haunts you
You need to drill down deep into your failures, your past , your insecurities. Just getting better at different tasks isn’t good enough. You need to own your past , other wise whenever hard times come, that rug is pulled and the demons surface

When you get to a point where you can tell anyone anything they want to know about you , you’ve cracked the code. You no longer care about people judging you

Don’t put a title on successful people that makes them seem gifted or lucky, that’s a get out of jail free card for you . If you do that you’re afraid to face who you are, there’s no excuse to be where you’re at and not doing anything to get where you want to be

You need to become you’re own hero 

Challenge #4 -- Choose any competitive situation that you’re in right now. That may mean acing an exam, or crafting an ideal proposal, etc. Whatever it is, I want you to work harder on that project or in that class than you ever have before. Do everything exactly as they ask, and whatever standard they set as an ideal outcome, you should be aiming to surpass that. Take their negativity and use it to dominate their task with everything you’ve got. Take their motherfucking soul!

Challenge 5 - paint a picture of success for difficult tasks before you start them, visualize it - visualize the potential challenges and how you can attempt to deal with them. You’ll also answer why you want this.

Challenge 6 - create a cookie jar for yourself of small victories to build on

Once you set your mindset during a painful situation to “how can I do this?” Your mind magically seems to find a way and have the energy to find a way. Once you know you’re not going to quit, your mind says okay I guess let’s do this

The most powerful tool in the world is your mind. You don’t need a guru , psychiatrist, or trainers and teachers - you can do it on your own, but you have to accept you’ll go through a bunch of shit to do so

When you’re in a comfortable environment (e.g at home on the couch), your mind fools you. You say you’ll take on all these challenging things. If you allow your mind to remain undisciplined in an environment of intense suffering, it will default to answering crucial questions with “I don’t know” , the easiest way to relieve itself

People change so many things about their lives , but the one thing that’s often missed is changing your mind and how you think
“I’m not crazy, I’m just not like you”. Don’t put a label on me
Ask yourself what am I capable of? Just know that when your mind tells you to stop, and it will, there’s still more left in the tank

Everyone has different tolerances to suffering, and we all have the universal impulse to succumb and give up 

Most of us give up when we’ve reached 40% of our limit. Need to stretch your pain tolerance, your mind is just trying to seek comfort and keep the status quo

In life almost everything doesn’t go as we hoped, we’ll all be tempted to leave commitments 

We don’t rise to our expectations, we fall to our training 

Challenge 7 - push past your normal stopping points, 5-10% further when your mind is telling you to give up. Life is one big mind game that you’re playing against yourself 

Create backstops as part of your strategy 

When life has obstacles for you, how are you going to handle it. They’re yours to own or say whoa is me 

The best way to overcome fears and insecurities is to master them. Sometimes you don’t know what your afraid of, learn about it. Become a master of your insecurities, especially if it’s not going away. Face it head on

Challenge 8 - stop the multitasking and half assing 
Refuse compromising yourself for others unwritten rules 
Be the uncommon among the uncommon if you need to

A true leader stays exhausted, abhors arrogance, and never looks down on the weakest link, he fights for his men and leads by example. Being the best and helping your people be their best 
You’re either getting better or getting worse, and if you aren’t changing for the better or at all , then you’re getting worse

Always be willing to embrace ignorance and become the dumbest person in the room again. It’s the only way to keep expanding your mind, body of knowledge, and body of work

When you become the uncommon among uncommon a drawback you’ll face is disappointment in others not meeting your expectations, but don’t lord that over them, it’s your problem to deal with. Realize that your supposed superiority is just a figment of your ego, it doesn’t help you as an individual or your team. Instead of getting angry at your colleagues, help pick them up, help them to become the best version of themselves and not your ideals / expectations

Challenge 9 - how do you stand out from the best? Don’t rest on your laurels, become the best of the best
Don’t listen to anybody who isn’t trying to do what you’re trying to do or putting in the same amount of effort

Challenge 10 - create AAR’s (after action reports) for your failures. What went well, want wrong, schedule another attempt to try it again. Focus more on owning it, being alone with your thoughts to do this - don’t look for pats on the back from other people without doing this introspection. If you fail again, take the pain, repeat these steps, and try again

What were you thinking ? How was your preparation vs. execution vs. outcome ? How did it affect your life and relationships? 

Your friends and family are watching and even if you’re surrounded by positive people, who mean no harm, they want you to be safe, comfortable, and happy. They don’t want us to get hurt. They have ideas of who you are, what you’re capable of, and how you should focus your energy. If you go out of that box , you’ll start getting lots of unsolicited advice, that will smother your aspirations if you let it. There’s a lot of potential in the moments of pain / broken dreams, a lot of power if you give yourself the opportunity to put it back together if you fail 

Each specific life comes with its own personalized pains, sadness, and loss. In response most of us are programmed to seek comfort to numb it. We consume media that confirms ours beliefs. We take up hobbies aligned with our talents. We spend as little time as possible on the tasks we loathe and that makes us soft. We live a life defined by the limits we imagine and desire for ourselves, because it’s comfortable as hell in that box. Not just for ourselves, but for our family and friends. The limits we create and accept become the lens they see us, through which they love and appreciate us for. But for some these limits start to feel like bondage, and when we least expect it our imagination jumps those walls - it hunts down dreams. We are inspired to make changes little by little and it takes hard work - self doubt and pain will greet you to bring you down. Most people who are just inspired / motivated won’t make it. The few who remain outside the walls will receive even more pain and doubt, especially from people you thought were your fans and the haters. But the only voice that will really break you down is what you tell yourself. The most important conversations you will have are with yourself. You wake up with them , walk around with them, go to bed with them, eventually you act on them - whether good / bad. You can neutralize self doubt by asking “What if?” It’s a reminder that you don’t know what your capable of, until you put everything on the line.

We live in a world with a lot of insecure, jealous people. Failure terrifies them, so does our success. When we transcend our box, our light reflects off of all the walls they’ve built up with their boxes. If they’re the great people you imagined them to be, they’re jealousy will transform into inspirations for them to leave their boxes, and it will be their turn to change for the better 

Goggin’s biggest fear :
Imagine this : you die, go to heaven, you meet God and he has a piece of paper in front of him with your name. You see a bunch of achievements on it that you don’t recognize, some you do. You ask “what’s this ?” God responds : “this is the life you were supposed to have” and shakes his head because you missed the mark. And at that point are you really in heaven or are you in hell ? Goggins: I want god himself (the one who knows all) to be in awe, I want him to keep adding to the paper. I want to exceed even God’s expectations of what He thought I was capable of. This is the mindset we should all have for the rest of our lives, there is no finish line, to find true pride to what you’ve done on this earth with this life

You’ll never be ready for what you have to do, you just do it and that makes you ready. Take action, have a bias for action (
