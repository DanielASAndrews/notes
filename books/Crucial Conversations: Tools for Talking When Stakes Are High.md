A conversation with high emotions, has high stakes , and different opinions

What’s the crucial conversation not being had or avoided ? This would likely solve the problem you are worrying about 

Ask yourself :  What do you really want from the conversation? This relationship?

Focus on yourself first before others

Refuse suckers choices (all or nothing / silence & violence).  Use AND how can I get this result AND this one

Do you recognize when conversations become crucial ?

I see you’re frustrated
I can see I’m getting frustrated, can we slow down for a moment?
I can tell this is important to you
We see this issue very differently, I want to know where you’re coming from 

Use your third eye / ear to:
Notice when a debate is happening and stop that, you want a dialogue with shared learnings and acknowledgements aka the pool of meaning 

The conversation has become unsafe when people feel they aren’t being respected - then they focus everything on just trying to defend their dignity. Look for hurt feelings, clamming up, start taking cheap shots or insults 

Silence:
Withdraw , avoiding , masking 

Moving to silence - any action to withhold important information from the pool of meaning

Call themselves peacemakers (don’t want to rock the boat or offend) , improperly named, they are problem hiders. They value harmony over quality , getting along more than getting results - a suckers choice.  Ultimately makes for poor decisions as results 

Silence is more common than violence, these people don’t realize that they can have candour and good relationships 


Violence:

Controlling:
Monologuing
Interrupting 
Interrogation 
Changing the subject

Labelling:
Sarcasm to ridicule 

Attacking:
Belittling
Destroy the person rather than the ideas

Feedback is the breakfast of champions 

Dialogue states observations and asks questions 
Dialogue values both quality and harmony , they don’t make the suckers choice (silence (pure harmony) and violence (pure quality))

Creating safety necessities:

Mutual Purpose
Foundation of trust, if people believe your intent is positive they’re willing to put up with potentially painful content 
The more sensitive the content the more of a mutual purpose you need

Without mutual purpose, the other person becomes seen as malicious or self serving ... and then you start measuring your words

We begin to feel we need to choose between honesty and kindness, a suckers choice

You 
Mutual Respect
Violence destroys respect
To restore them:
Sincere apology - after you’ve been insulting
Apology should be given to heal hurt feelings not as compensation for being wronged

Contrasting
Use before saying something that you know might harm safety
Say what you don’t mean and what you mean , both sides of the coin

Ask yourself :

Don’t mean:
What might they think about my motives?
What might they think about my respect for them?
Do mean:
What are my motives? Etc.
I do want/mean ____ , I don’t/mean want ____

CRIB

For genuine or contrasting differences, where it often creates win-lose or lose-lose for the two people 

Stand for Commit to mutual purpose, recognize the purpose behind the strategy , invent a mutual purpose, brainstorm new strategies

C : point out that you have differing purposes here, so agree to search for a common purpose

R : recognize what you want vs how you’re going about it, becareful of how you’re going about it mutating into what you want. And see what their want and how is by asking probing questions: why do you ..... , what is it you really want ? Sometimes you can come to a mutual purpose from this

I : agree on a long term goal even if you let the short term goal go. This creates mutual purpose

B : jointly search for strategies, you are now in safe dialogue again 

Thinking about what your feeling:
Become conscious when dealing with strong emotions :

Silence : You become an accomplice when you don’t speak out against bad behaviour, you help perpetuate it

Violence: move from resent to resembling the same bad behaviour 
Are you conscious of the story you are telling yourself which is driving your emotions ? Any set of facts can produce many stories - there are a variety of emotions you can feel. Emotions come from the stories, not the facts

Which emotions will lead to the results you really want ?
Separate what is the story from the facts. It’s so easy to mistake the story for the facts plus confirmation bias
Stories become filters for confirmation bias

Downward spiral :
I act in exactly the way I need to to prove them right and then they act likewise... neither of you gets what you want and both of you act in a way that guarantees this - the downward spiral
Treat stories as facts, react to that, and then use that as evidence to prove the other person isn’t on our side
Watch for 3 stories that make us feel good about doing bad (silence & violence)

Victim story:
What is the worst and most hurtful way I can take this ? (He thinks work is more important than I am etc. All supporting the bad idea that ‘he doesn’t care about me’)
It’s not my fault

Villain story:
It’s all your fault 
Take certain facts about the story to make them the villain
I’m powerless story:
Feel no responsibility to take action
We need these stories to feel good about doing bad, to not have dialogue 
We are misled to think results are equal to no results + a clever story 

You can affect your emotions by critiquing your story
We are not trying to pretend that others don’t have flaws, but we are trying to create a new story with supportive emotions that create dialogue - even to confront bad behaviour - we want our response to be proportional and effective that leads to results 
You can create this new story by adding your role to the story, which is something you leave out/

We don’t tell self justifying stories until we have something to justify. E.g not hitting the open button when you see someone coming to get the elevator. You make up a reason after the fact that says how important you and how not important they are
Watch for creating a sellout justification story at the start of the downward spiral. These things E.g You feel you should help someone but don’t. You feel you should apologize but don’t. You fail to follow up. You do less than your share of the work for the team and don’t say anything and you know no else will either. These are all things you feel ashamed about in retrospect but feel good about in the moment

Either admit or justify. Justify creates the victim , villain , and helpless stories

Ask 3 questions :

What am I pretending not to know about role in this ? Solves victim, asks you to admit your sellout 

Why would a reasonable and decent person do this ? Solves villain, turns villains into humans, makes you look for their human motives 

What is the right thing to do right now to move toward what I really want ? Solves helpless, moves you to productive action 

Preventing defensiveness :

Don’t start with conclusion. Share the facts, tell your story, ask them for their facts and their story , keeping in mind:

Don’t use absolutes

Don’t push to hard

Speak tentatively 

Encourage testing

Tentative language let’s them know you’re not there to give them a lecture but get to the truth. It also shows you want to hear their views. And show you mean it- you really want to hear their view. Especially important if you’re in a position of authority 
If there are high emotions don’t tell the other person to calm down, instead use these 4 skills:

AMPP

Ask
Ask others to express their full opinion

Mirror 
Describe what you think you see (it’s seems like you are concerned?)
You need to mirror the tone and attitude , delivery is everything ... “if you are feeling ... , that’s okay with me “

Paraphrase 
Restating calmly without being shocked or upset it increases the safety 
Don’t overuse !! Otherwise people get frustrated that you’re just repeating what they’re saying all the time

Prime
If you push to hard trying to make it safe it might start coming off as forced or pestering , then you need to back off and look to priming instead
Take you me best guess at what they’re thinking and state it as a question 

For strong disagreements:
We tend to focus on the disagreement and not at all on where we agree, so we need to focus on agreement first 

ABC

Agree when you can

Build on that agreement, new piece of information 
Compare where you differ , don’t flat out disagree to be disrespectful 

Move to action:

Closure - avoid 2 common pitfalls in decision making:
Talking about the same issues over and over again by documenting decisions and holding people accountable to action
They don’t confuse dialogue with decision making, they come to an agreement on how decisions are made

In most good teams, consensus is NOT the way decisions are made. Consensus should only be used when the cost of dialogue from everyone is worth the benefit of the decision (e.g. ask get 30 people to get average of temperature in a room , vs one person using a thermometer. The former is an ineffective decision) 

4 types of decision making
Command - one person decides
Consult - hear everyone , select group will decide
Consensus - everyone must agree
Vote - highest vote wins

Before having dialogue about a decision it’s important that participants know how the decision will be made
Spell out specific deliverables , and who does what by when
Assignments without deadlines creates guilt, should have followup points

Summarize accountability at the end of the conversation

Dialogue between leaders and direct reports:
It’s even more important to create the dialogue safe to get genuine views, because of the prevalent learning of always agree with the boss or being nice to the boss

When direct reports offer an opposing view, Appreciate it and make sure you’re expressing your point of view as an opinion and not a fact (e.g these are the conclusions I have for these reasons, and then ask for disconfirming data - is there something I’m overlooking ? Is there some other way to see this ? This shows sincerity in wanting the best decision rather than enlist them in your view or trying to sell them on your cause)

When trying to coach performance: You must really have intent to fix problems rather than affix blame, then the reports move to silence or violence )

Don’t speak out of anger, don’t wait until a problem builds, the emotions peak, and you’re not in a position to handle the conversation well. You’re about to feed the very fear that has kept you from saying something in the first place, you were afraid of being honest with your boss because it might get you into trouble, and now even a simple remark can set you off, explode and attack and create the horrible situation you feared all along. You’re more likely to move to silence the next time round

If you’re about to have a crucial conversation with your boss , make an appointment and rehearse it or at least write down what you think might work 

I would start with contrasting:

If you catch it early on
“I’d like to talk about something you’re doing that’s beginning to bother me. It’s not a big deal, but I’d like to talk about it before it grows into something between us”

Telling others you assume that they aren’t bad in their motives, this sets the write tone . Useful in almost any feedback discussion 

Your tone should say “this is important enough talk about, but I’m not over the top on this one.” Watch your emotions, don’t appear angry or fearful because it will make the conversation risky and maybe draw emotions out from them
