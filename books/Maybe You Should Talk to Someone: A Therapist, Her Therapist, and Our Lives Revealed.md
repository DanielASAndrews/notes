There’s something likeable you can find in anyone if you get to know them

Change can only come from loss

If the queen has balls she’d be the king (good vs perfection)

When people are in pain and they share it, they want someone to sit with them through their pain. This is hard to find, and that’s why people go to therapists 

Your feeling don’t have to mesh with what you think they should be, don’t judge your feelings, notice them and use them to help you find the truth

Pain can be associated with the past, present, and future

Trying to have the fantasy of Creating a better past. When the present falls apart so does the future with it 

You can become stuck in perpetual regret and suffering when you are afraid of the pain from the loss of the future (e.g cyberstalking ex-gf seeing them in their future while you’re stuck in the past - but if you focus on the present, can you sit through the pain, or do you want to suffer?)

Peoples view on how their parents raised them and what they have to say about their parents can be big keys to solving their current problems and their relationship to the past (attachment styles, narcissist pd , borderline pd, obsessive compulsive pd, etc.)

Mood disorders vs personality disorders is interesting 

Therapy shouldn’t always feel comfortable , it’s suppose to help you grow, and therapists are there for support, not to agree with you (I.e about your shitty boss)

Women have the cultural pressure to keep up physical appearance, men have cultural pressure to keep up emotional appearance 
Therapy is to help you move on to the next problem instead of being stuck on the current one

Projective identification

People never never want to be told what to do , even if they ask for it. They may like it at first but resent it later. Humans want agency over their own life

Sometime people don’t want to change even if they say they do, in those cases you have to change 

Between stimulus and response there is space.
In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom. -Victor frankl 

Apologies are tricky:
who are you apologizing for ? Because it makes you feel better or make the other person feel better ?

Are you sorry for what you’ve done ? Or are you saying sorry to placate the other person who feels you should be sorry for what you’ve done (and you yourself feel completely justified in what you’ve done)

“Forced forgiveness” - you don’t always have to forgive someone or condone their actions to move on. It’s more about forgiving yourself for having feelings you ‘shouldn’t’ have, and having compassion for yourself and the other person. Again, you don’t have to forgive them

There’s no hierarchy of pain / suffering. Pain is pain. You can’t get over your pain by diminishing it, you get through it by accepting it and figuring out what to do with it. This includes judging others pain

Paradoxical intervention, brings to light that ‘impossible’ problems are voluntary to client

Even in the best possible relationship, you’re going to get hurt sometimes. Even the people you love most, you will hurt them, not because you want to, but because you’re human. Your partners, your children, your family, and they will hurt you. Getting hurt is part of the deal of intimacy.

Empathy builder : How would someone hearing this feel ? How would this specific person feel hearing this ?

When you’re stuck between two seemingly bad choices, what if you choose neither ? Is there a third hidden option ?

Keep ‘sometimes’ in mind for a more balanced, realistic perspective. It helps to avoid extremes, black and white thinking. E.g I’m am an asshole sometimes, they’re an asshole sometimes
