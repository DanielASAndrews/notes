3 groups will thrive:
Those who are the best in their field
Those who can get artificially intelligent machines to do things for them
Those with access to large amounts of capital 

High level Executives gain their effectiveness through managing communication below them , so they are an exception 

Choosing clarity on what matters also provides clarity on what does not

Watch out for busyness as a proxy for being productive 

Technolopoly - assumption that because it’s high tech it’s good

Living by your inbox leads to the shallow, trivial and often stressful life. When you’re idle enough to spend enough time doing that , you begin to focus on what could be wrong rather than what is going right for you

Work is easier to enjoy than relaxation time because they have built in feedback loops, goals , and challenges all of which encourage you to lose yourself into concentration, from the author of Flow (Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi)

Humans beings are at their best (including happiness) when immersed in something challenging

3 different types of schedule work:

Monastic, eliminate most shallow 
Bimodal, some time to deep at least a day , rest to shallow 
Rhythmic, do it as a habit every day

Rhythmic is provably the one that’s going to apply to you 
Journalistic - whenever you can

Come up with a ritual , what you do before, what you drink and eat, the area you’re in, etc. Important for open offices

Grand gesture for deep work improves the dedication and result (e.g JK Rowling staying at an expensive hotel outside of the Scottish castle to finish the deathly hallows, bill gates think week at his cabin)

Open offices are built for serendipity

The assumption that deep work doesn’t promote serendipitous creation is flawed 

Hub and spokes office design is better , e.g bell labs, building 20

Collaborative deep work - optimize collaborations (white-boarding) and deep work separately 

Execute like a business, how would you treat your work if you were the ceo of your own company ?

4dx framework ? Look this up 

4 discipline rules

small number of ambitious outcomes 

Act on lead measures , not lag measures

Keep a compelling score card (e.g score card of deep work hours)

Create regular retros for score cards

Study shown spending some time in nature helps replenish capacity for deep work (didn’t even matter that it was winter , still true)
Zagarnic effect , have a shutdown ritual 

Instead of scheduling deep work , schedule distractions - this will help you transition your brain from its current addictions to shallow stimulation being the default

When you have the strong urge to check your smartphone or the internet (might even be because you need to look something up to help you with your deep work), take a 5 minute break and do something else relaxing or switch to a different deep work task. This helps displace the desire from the reward. The right thing to do is shorten the time to your next internet connected block, and don’t make that happen immediately. At least take 5 minutes to do something else, even if bored

Schedule your at home time this way too, because if you only do it at work it will be harder

Get comfortable with being bored again with just your thoughts

Any benefit principle - we use a technology because we can’t think of a benefit it provides , but what we should do is weigh the cons as well (e.g Facebook a new form of entertainment, cons: you already had other options for entertainment, it distracts you from deep work)

always keep in mind the opportunity cost of the thing you’re doing 

Craftsman’s approach to tools : positive impacts help what’s important to you and outweighs the negative impacts. This is in contrast to the any benefit principle

You could be taking away time from high impact activities by spending it on low impact activities (social networks)

Taking a good friend out to lunch vs keep in touch with surface level friends on a social network

Your attention and time are limited 

Ryan Nicadaemous packed all his stuff in boxes and observed over his normal routine that a lot of his stuff stayed in the boxes, he didn’t need it 
Stuff accumulates in peoples lives because when faced with the elimination of it, they worry “what if I need this someday ?” And then use that as an excuse to keep it. Nicadaemous experiment proved he didn’t need it

Do the same experiment with your social media for 30 days, temporarily quit them, don’t tell anyone your going to do this 

Ask yourself:
would the last 30 days been notably better with this service?
Did people care that I wasn’t using this service ?
If both are no or ambiguous , quit em

These products have done well to give people FOMO to help make them addictive 
With the experiment you can reduce this FOMO

You can test your status as a content creator by dropping off these. Most of the content status you perceive is actually an low worth exchange (Facebook I’ll like your content if you like mine) rather than actual value. Getting a genuine content following online is hard 

Number of services with attention grabbing things will only increase 

Schedule meaningful activities/hobbies during your free time that help you get better at skills or have goals. These have been shown to still replenish your energy and act as downtime , and is arguably better than spending it on shallow work which tends to end up being your default plan of action if you don’t structure your free time. The mind likes and can sustained mental challenges, they just have to change is all rather than be all one thing.

Schedule blocks of time in a worst case scenario way, people tend to be too optimistic

Schedule overflow conditional blocks after a task which can be used for extra underestimated time or moving on to the next task
If you are making good progress/have an unexpected insight on something or are in flow, feel free to ignore the schedule. Once done readjust the schedule and continue. The task blocks are meant to focus time on deep work and not a hindrance. It treats your time with respect 

What is a shallow task : non cognitively demanding tasks that are often logistical , done when distracted, don’t make meaningful contribution to the world, and are easily replicated 

Determine if a task is shallow by asking :
How long would it take in months to train a recent bright college graduate to do this task ? Use 3 months as a conservative max time 

When you refuse a request, don’t be specific because it gives the other person a way to try to fit their thing in your schedule. Just say something like, Sorry I can’t make it due to schedule conflicts - be vague

Use a sender filter - be specific about what communication you want and will more likely respond to. This greatly reduces the number of useless communications (e.g recruiter emails) “I’ll only respond to those that are a good fit for my interests and schedule “ help remove sense of obligation to response to emails as well - people end up respecting this and feeling happier when you do respond to them

Used process centric responses to emails to reduce the amount of back and forth messages. When you get an email, pause for a moment before replying and answer:

What is the project represented by this message and what is the most efficient in terms of messages generated to bring this project to a successful conclusion ?

Example:
“I’d l love to grab coffee. Let’s meet at the Starbucks on campus.
Below I listed two days where I’m free and 3 times. If any one of those work for you, let me know. I’ll consider your reply confirmation for the meeting
If none of them work, give me a call at the number below and we’ll hash it out 
Looking forward to it”
The email should try to close the loop to free you from long email chains 

If the email sounds too technical, keep a conversational preamble and the divide it with a line saying “ proposed next steps “

Don’t answer emails where nothing really bad would happen if you didn’t respond and nothing really good would happen if you did
