### Questions

### Content

What if that thing you’re working toward that you're sure you think will make you happy , better, or more confident, doesn’t happen ? Even if it does arrive someday, What happens to your from now until then ? It’s not that you have to find the answer, you are the answer, your mindset

Reject your sense of injury, and the injury itself disappears - Marcus Aurelius 

There is no greater knowledge than the one you have taken in and verified for yourself 

When you read books providing advice, take them on as an experiment rather than just an assessment of the content. Some of it will confront, annoy, and exasperate you, get over yourself, it might all come together in the end 

I am willing

You have the life you’re willing to put up with. If you’re willing to put up with your situation, then that is the life you’ve chosen, whether you like it or not. By defending your circumstances as they are right now, you’re actually making a case for being where you are. This is good to realize because it’s the first step of acceptance you need to have the will to change 

“Circumstances don’t make the man, they only reveal them to himself” -Epictetus

you are 100% responsible in what you do in the aftermath of bad things happening to you

Fate leads the willing, and drags along the reluctant - Seneca

Life won’t stop for your procrastinators or fears, it will go on
Frame your life , your wants , in terms of “I am willing” or “I am not willing” to give the right perspective on making decisions. E.g “I am willing to go to the gym everyday”, “I am unwilling to put up with unsustainable relationships”

A lot of the time we forget why we’re pursuing things because we’re so focused on what we don’t have - we don’t really want it
E.g “I am unwilling to trade time with my family for an extra 0 on my paycheck “

I am wired to win

You are always winning at the life you have, even if it doesn’t seem that way. You subconsciously make choices that fulfill the goals and conclusions you’ve made about yourself and life. E.g what if you’re driven to prove that no one will ever love you ? So you deliberately pick and create relationships that undermine you and ~always end prematurely to prove your point (and you are great at doing this, you win at doing this) You very much succeeded at doing this

Look at the areas of your life where you’re the most ineffective. Our thoughts are so powerful at pushing us toward are goals, even if we don’t realize what the goals are. You are be winning / succeeding at those goals even if you don’t want them consciously. Problem arises when our subconscious has different goals than our conscious

Have you considered the subconscious ideas you have that maybe driving your actions? (about your class, your weight etc.)
Your actions serve to keep you in place in your subconscious domains (e.g making $60,000 is not that different than $30,000 even if you’ve made it out to be in your mind. It’s still the same time being put in for both cases)

You got this 

When you’re dealing with a problem that’s bothering you take a step back, way back, and then view it. Look to the past - back on your previous biggest problems, you overcame those (related to the cookie jar from goggins) and remember how shitty they made you feel at the time ? Even if they were awful, they probably seem a lot different today, and they did help make you who you are. Now look to the future - all of the experiences and events awaiting you in life, new relationships with people you’ve yet to meet , places to visit, the spine tingling sensation of kissing someone you’re really attracted to, the peace and satisfaction of growing old with the people you love, maybe you’ll have kids and watch them grow up, and maybe they’ll introduce you to the love of their life and grandkids, a night of laughing with your best friends. The problems you have today are passing scene in your life, taking a step back like this exercise gives you that perspective 

Like a captain figuring out how to readjust their course on stormy seas, you must do the same with the strong waves of problems you face. You had back then and you have all you need to now to get through it.

The only thing that is certain is uncertainty, and I embrace it
Uncertainly is where things happen, your personal pathway to opportunity. It’s where you experience new things and produce unprecedented results

“The desire for safety stands against every noble enterprise“ -Tacitus

You can’t predict what the people you know will do, let alone yourself , your own thoughts and feelings.

Success is never certain and never comes without risk - the people who do great things in their lives know this and embrace it

“In any decision, the best thing to do is the right thing, the next best thing is the wrong thing, and the worst thing you can do is nothing “ - Theodore Roosevelt 

When we’re no longer uncertain about money the desire/the need even to pursuit recedes, success our ambition can blunt or mellow and we settle for an illusion. We go soft

Even if you chase certainty you won’t find it, it’s an illusion, and the universe will remind you of that

All I know is that I know nothing - Socrates

When we think we know everything, we inadvertently turn ourselves away from the unknown, and by default whole new realms of success
One of the pillars of philosophy is the examination of how we know what we know, and how to prove it, in most cases we can’t.

When you stop trying to be certain about the future and refusing to accept things when they won’t or aren’t going your way, a lot of your stress won’t make sense 

You are not your thoughts, you are your actions 

What you think and what you do, don’t have to align (in regards to negative thoughts)

Great thoughts only speak to the thoughtful mind, great actions speak to all mankind - Theodore Roosevelt 

You don’t have to feel it’s your day today, you cant act like it is, do it anyway

Your thoughts become reality, but it’s only through actions that they become your life

When we act, we don’t have time to worry about your fears. You just need to get that momentum, don’t get stuck waiting to feel productive , getting things aligned right, just do it

Do you think Steve Jobs or Gandhi were productive everyday, or learned all they needed to know for preparation to do what they did ? Do you think they never had fear and doubts and uncertainty about what they wanted to do? They had sleepless nights, worried, and battled. You wouldn’t even know them, had they kept their ideas as thoughts instead of acting their passion out. They toiled into the unknown anyway 

Positive or negative thinking, neither matters, acting does. There’s plenty of successful people with negative thoughts.

“Thoughts are like birds, You cannot keep birds from flying over your head but you can keep them from building a nest in your hair” - Martin Luther 

I am relentless 

Our greatest successes come our of discomfort, uncertainty, and risk - being out of your comfort zone 

People expect you to be a specific kind of person , so when you break out of that your messing with yours and their world

“It is the mark of an educated mind to entertain a thought without accepting it” - Aristotle

You can never really know what’s possible and what’s impossible, neither does anyone else. You can throw yourself at something 1000 times and fail, and on attempt 1001 succeed

To become relentless, focus on the problem in front of you, keep at it till you find an answer, and then move on to the next obstacle - hammer and chisel chilling at the problem piece by piece, not worrying about chartering the path into the unknown , keep the momentum going and eventually you get there. Become someone who progresses when all seems lost, no matter what, you have relentlessness. Put in the reps, the only way is forward

I expect nothing and accept everything 

Your powerlessness is caused by the difference between your hidden expectations and reality. Anywhere where you become disappointed, angry, resentment, or are deflated, any place where you’re not yourself. E.g your marriage failing because it’s not how you expected it would be. The greater the gap the worse you’ll feel

The way we feel about our expectations not being met (for example last time you were angry with someone because they didn’t do something according to your expectations) doesn’t do anything toward solving the problems and in fact derails us by wasting our energy trying to get life to meet our expectations again (which you can’t most likely). It blows the original problems out of proportion and dilute your power to deal with life’s unpredictability

You can always change something by owning it, and in fact it’s the best route to do so, especially things you don’t accept or agree with 

If the relationship is struggling take a step back and look at your expectations. Many of us expect our partners to be a certain way consistently and always anticipate our needs and know exactly what we’re feeling. But our partners, like us, is an imperfect human with their own complicated thoughts and emotions. It’s appropriate that they might get distracted or short with you on a bad day 

We often expect others to treat us the way we treat them, it becomes an unspoken debt that creates resentment because it’s so easy for them to not meet those expectations 

Your partners , friends , family all have their own perceptions , desires , and feelings. Don’t expect them to change the way you feel, only you can do that.

People are always going to lie, steal, cheat etc. Expecting that not to happen and then feeling resentful isn’t connected to reality. In those cases you always end up worse off than they do. With the resentment, anger, and frustration, they’re not doing that to you, you are. You can accept things for what they are, it doesn’t mean you condone them or that you won’t decisively change them. It’s about becoming a master of your emotions with your mind, being in control and power without succumbing to your internal and external upsets.

For your plans , treat it as a dance with life where you can execute the plan and deal with what happens, if it starts failing, then recalibrate

Be free to love people the way they are, and be loved the way they love you - let the chips fall where they may instead of comparing it to your expectations 

Love the life you have, not the one you expected to have
Don’t become a personal development drone. You can know tons of cool shit but it’s made little or no difference to the trajectory of your life.

E.g “when I find the root of my procrastination or when I find something to motivate me, I’ll be completely unleashed and happy”. The desire to work on our procrastination just keeps us in a cycle of procrastinating and not procrastinating, keeps us even further from forwarding our actual lives. We’re waiting for everything to be perfect (it never is)

Future you is not going to regret the absence of something in your life, but rather your failure to even try, not striving, not pushing through 

E.g you won’t regret not having a million dollars, you’ll regret not starting a business you wanted to, you won’t regret not dating a super model, you’ll regret staying in a dead end relationship - you’ll regret not being proud of the life you’ve lived

Stop buying yourself off - I can’t , should of, could of, would of etc. You end up creating a growing relationship with yourself as a bullshitter 

Successful people are flying the airplane while building it, if it’s not working, the piece back together and try again, they’re not waiting for a certain moment or internal condition 

Stop blaming your past - why do you show more passion for your past than your future?

Easy choices, hard life. Hard choices, Easy life - Jerzy Gregorek
Don’t trade short term goodness (cheesecake, bagels with cream cheese, etc.) for long term greatness
